- A: Yes.

- Q: Should I try it with my main wallet?
- A: No.

- Q: Should I try it with a smaller wallet then?
- A: Still no.

- Q: Should I ever let this program touch a mainnet menmonic?
- A: No.

- Q: Is this gonna be developed into a stable product?
- A: I doubt.

- Q: Why did you make it then?
- A: I've been working on abstract/generalized libraries for a while now, and I was starting to detach from reality a little bit: sometimes
   it really helps to try and build something with your own libraries to see where the interface can be improved.

- Q: Did it actually help?
- A: Yes.

- Q: That's good!
- A: Indeed.
